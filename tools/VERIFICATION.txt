## Verification Instructions for LaLs Package

To verify the authenticity of this package, you can follow the steps outlined below:

1. Check the SHA256 Checksum of the Downloaded Package:  
   You can verify the integrity of the package by calculating the checksum of the installed `.nupkg` file and comparing it with the provided checksum.  
   Run the following command in PowerShell:  

   Get-FileHash "C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\LaLs\LaLs.nupkg" -Algorithm SHA256  

   Compare the resulting hash value with the checksum provided on the Chocolatey package page.

2. Inspect the PowerShell Module Signature:  
   If applicable, check if the `LaLs.psm1` file is signed with a valid signature. Run the following command in PowerShell:  

   Get-AuthenticodeSignature "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\LaLs\LaLs.psm1"  

   Verify that the `Status` field is set to `Valid`. If the signature is invalid, it may indicate that the file has been tampered with or was not properly signed.

3. Check the Package Version and Metadata:  
   Compare the installed version with the one listed on the Chocolatey package page:  

   choco list --local-only LaLs  

   This command will display the installed version and package metadata to ensure it matches the expected version.

4. Review Installed Files:  
   Check the contents of the package installation directory to verify that no unexpected files are present:  

   Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\LaLs" -Recurse  

   Compare these files with the package documentation or listing on the Chocolatey package page.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the LaLs package you installed is authentic and has not been altered. If any verification steps fail, please contact the package maintainer or the Chocolatey community for further assistance.
